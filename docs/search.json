    "text": "Introduction\nThis project is focusing on the credit market in Australia. It intends to use Bayesian VAR approach in forecasting of lending amounts.\nThe Research Objective and Question The research aims to forecast lending indicators, specifically lending amounts, in Australia. Thus, the research question is: How can the lending indicators in Australia be accurately forecasted, and what are the resulting forecasts?\nMotivation of Research For banks and related financial institutions, they need to manage the risks associated with future interest rate fluctuations. Accurate lending amount forecasting can assist them in better assessing and managing risks, thereby safeguarding their assets and maintaining financial stability."

    "text": "Data and Properties\nThis section shows the data collection and their descriptive statistic including their series plotting and basic properties analyzing.\n\nVariables Selection\nThe selection of variables grounds in several macroeconomic indicators, derived from the official databases of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The rationale for the choice of variables is informed by the work of scholars Marta Bańbura, Domenico Giannone, and Michele Lenza (2015) on European macroeconomic forecasting.\nThese indicators are closely linked to both loan rates and volumes. An increase in CPI and housing price indices signifies a decline in the purchasing power of money, necessitating a rise in loan rates to compensate for inflationary losses. Growth in GDP indicates economic expansion, leading to increased demand for capital, and consequently, higher loan volumes and rates. Higher unemployment rates suggest an economic downturn, prompting banks to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Additionally, an abundance of monetary supply leads banks to reduce loan rates to attract more borrowers.\nTherefore, in my project, these following specific variables are used in BVAR model:\n\n\\(m1_t\\): M1 aggregate from RBA Database\n\\(cpi_t\\): CPI aggregate from ABS Database\n\\(cashrate_t\\): Cash Rate Target aggregate from RBA Database\n\\(gdp_t\\): Expenditure on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) aggregate from ABS Database\n\\(unemploy_t\\): Unemplyemnt person aggregate from ABS Database\n\\(ppi_t\\): PPI aggregate from ABS Database\n\nFor the loan volumes to be forecasted, I have categorized them into housing loans and commercial loans, as they represent two distinct types of demand. The underlying logic influenced by macroeconomic factors might differ between them:\n\n\\(houselend_t\\): House lending volume aggregate from RBA\n\\(businesslend_t\\): Business lending volume aggregate from RBA\n\n\n\nTransformation and Properties of the Variables\nThe cash rate target, \\(Cash_Rate_t\\),is in percentages so it doesn’t nedd to be transformed. All other variables are applied in the log-transformation and the result are below:\n\n\\(m1_t=\\log(m1_t)\\)\n\\(cpi_t=\\log(cpi_t)\\)\n\\(gdp_t=\\log(gdp_t)\\)\n\\(unemploy_t=\\log(unemploy_t)\\)\n\\(ppi_t=\\log(ppi_t)\\)\n\\(houselend_t=\\log(houselend_t)\\)\n\\(businesslend_t=\\log(businesslend_t)\\)\n\nTheir time series plots result are below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Time Series Plots fpr Variables\n\n\n\n\nVariables’ stationarity is crucial for robustness of models and prediction stability, so we need to use Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to make sure that the variables are stationary.\nUsing the testing in levels, we can see except the cash rate target, all other variables are non-stationary because their p-values are lower than 0.05. So we will perform the ADF test on first diiference to confirm whether the variables are stationary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  ADF test results - Levels \n \n  \n    Test \n    Test_Statistic \n    P_Value \n    Lags \n  \n \n\n  \n    Cash_Rate_Target \n    -3.6252247 \n    0.0306399 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Unemployment \n    -2.4309694 \n    0.3952424 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    M1 \n    -2.6033276 \n    0.3229284 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    PPI \n    -1.9327309 \n    0.6045645 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    CPI \n    -1.2529339 \n    0.8911931 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    GDP \n    -2.5762913 \n    0.3335192 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Houselend \n    -0.0142653 \n    0.9900000 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Businesslend \n    -1.5052536 \n    0.7877237 \n    5 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the table below. we can see it is clear that in ADF test in first difference, all variables are statistically significant in stationary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  ADF test results - First Differences \n \n  \n    Test \n    Test_Statistic \n    P_Value \n    Lags \n  \n \n\n  \n    Cash_Rate_Target - First Difference \n    -5.188573 \n    0.0100000 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Unemployment - First Difference \n    -10.088903 \n    0.0100000 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    M1 - First Difference \n    -9.972948 \n    0.0100000 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    PPI - First Difference \n    -3.817442 \n    0.0207689 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    CPI - First Difference \n    -4.085297 \n    0.0100000 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    GDP - First Difference \n    -6.707176 \n    0.0100000 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Houselend - First Difference \n    -7.062507 \n    0.0100000 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Businesslend - First Difference \n    -6.713399 \n    0.0100000 \n    5 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit root test’s result can also showed from the Autocorrelation Functions (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (PACF) plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ACF Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: PACF Plots"

    "text": "Econometric Model and Hypothesis\nTo forecast the loan amount in housing and business sector, the Bayesian VAR model will be used in this project. Based on the credit forecast in previous research (Louzis, 2014), we simplify this project’s notation of BVAR with \\(p\\) lags below:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n   y_t &= \\mu_0 + A_1y_{t-1}+\\dots+A_py_{t-p}+u_t\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn this model, \\(y_t=[m1_t\\) , \\(cpi_t\\) , \\(cashrate_t\\) , \\(gdp_t\\) , \\(unemploy_t\\) , \\(ppi_t\\) , \\(houselend_t\\) , \\(businesslend_t]'\\) and it includes the eight variables we list above. The variables we used in forecasting is \\(houselend_t\\) and \\(businesslend_t\\). The \\(u_t\\) means the error term, which is assumed to be \\(u_t|Y_{t-1}\\sim\\;iid(\\textbf{0}_N,I_N)\\), and in this following model \\(N=8\\). \\(A_l\\) with l = 1, 2,…,p is an \\(n\\times n\\) coefficient matrix for each lag. We can re-write it into matrix form:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  Y &= XA + U \\\\\n  U &\\sim MN(0, \\Sigma \\otimes I_T)\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(Y\\) is a \\(T\\times n\\) matrix with \\(Y_{T \\times n} = \\left( y_1, y_2, ..., y_T \\right)'\\). \\(X\\) is a \\(T\\times k\\) matrix, where \\(k = 1 + np\\) as \\(p\\) is the lag order. It can be written as \\(X_{T \\times k} = \\left( x_1, x_2, ..., x_T \\right)'\\).\\(A\\) is the \\(n\\times k\\) matrix which can be written as \\(A_{n \\times k} = \\left( a_0, A_1,A_2 ..., A_p \\right)'\\). \\(U_n = \\left( u_1, u_2, ..., u_T \\right)\\) and it is a \\(1\\times T\\) matrix."
