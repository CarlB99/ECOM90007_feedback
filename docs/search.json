Accurate lending amount forecasting can assist them in better assessing and managing risks, thereby safeguarding their assets and maintaining financial stability."

    "section": "Variables Selection",
    "text": "Variables Selection\nThe selection of variables grounds in several macroeconomic indicators, derived from the official databases of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The rationale for the choice of variables is informed by the work of scholars Marta Ba≈Ñbura, Domenico Giannone, and Michele Lenza (2015) on European macroeconomic forecasting.\nThese indicators are closely linked to both loan rates and volumes. An increase in CPI and housing price indices signifies a decline in the purchasing power of money, necessitating a rise in loan rates to compensate for inflationary losses. Growth in GDP indicates economic expansion, leading to increased demand for capital, and consequently, higher loan volumes and rates. Higher unemployment rates suggest an economic downturn, prompting banks to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Additionally, an abundance of monetary supply leads banks to reduce loan rates to attract more borrowers.\nTherefore, in my project, these following specific variables are used in BVAR model:\n\n\\(M1_t\\): M1 aggregate from RBA Database\n\\(CPI_t\\): CPI aggregate from ABS Database\n\\(RPPI_t\\): Residential Property Price Index aggregate from ABS Database\n\\(GDP_t\\): Expenditure on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) aggregate from ABS Database\n\\(UNEMPLOY_t\\): Unemplyemnt person aggregate from ABS Database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the loan volumes to be forecasted, I have categorized them into housing loans and commercial loans, as they represent two distinct types of demand. The underlying logic influenced by macroeconomic factors might differ between them:\n\n\\(House Lending_t\\): House lending volume aggregate from RBA\n\\(Business Lending_t\\): Business lending volume aggregate from RBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         Test Test_Statistic   P_Value Lags\nDickey-Fuller  rp_price_index    -3.04993172 0.1473984    5\nDickey-Fuller1   Unemployment    -2.43096944 0.3952424    5\nDickey-Fuller2             M1    -2.60332764 0.3229284    5\nDickey-Fuller3            PPI    -1.93273093 0.6045645    5\nDickey-Fuller4            CPI    -1.25293390 0.8911931    5\nDickey-Fuller5            GDP    -2.57629126 0.3335192    5\nDickey-Fuller6      Houselend    -0.01426528 0.9900000    5\nDickey-Fuller7   Businesslend    -1.50525363 0.7877237    5\n\n\n\n\n                                            Test Test_Statistic    P_Value Lags\nDickey-Fuller  rp_price_index - First Difference      -2.434671 0.39828025    5\nDickey-Fuller1   Unemployment - First Difference     -10.088903 0.01000000    5\nDickey-Fuller2             M1 - First Difference      -9.972948 0.01000000    5\nDickey-Fuller3            PPI - First Difference      -3.817442 0.02076893    5\nDickey-Fuller4            CPI - First Difference      -4.085296 0.01000000    5\nDickey-Fuller5            GDP - First Difference      -6.707176 0.01000000    5\nDickey-Fuller6      Houselend - First Difference      -7.062507 0.01000000    5\nDickey-Fuller7   Businesslend - First Difference      -6.713399 0.01000000    5"
